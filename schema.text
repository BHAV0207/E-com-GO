E-commerce Backend Schema Overview
To keep your project clear and scalable, here's a high-level schema for a typical e-commerce backend (especially in a microservices or modular architecture). This will help you understand what major entities and services you'll need, and how they relate to each other.

Core Entities (Collections in MongoDB)
User

Fields: id, name, email, password_hash, address, role (customer/admin), created_at

Product

Fields: id, name, description, price, category, images, in_stock, created_at, updated_at

Order

Fields: id, user_id, items (list of product references + quantity), total_price, status (pending, paid, shipped, delivered), created_at, shipping_address

Cart

Fields: id, user_id, items (product references + quantity), updated_at

Payment

Fields: id, order_id, user_id, amount, method, status, transaction_id, created_at

Category

Fields: id, name, description, created_at

Inventory

Fields: product_id, quantity, warehouse_location

Review

Fields: id, product_id, user_id, rating, comment, created_at

Major Services/Modules
Authentication Service: Handles user registration, login, password hashing, JWT token generation.

Product Service: CRUD operations for products, category management, search/filtering.

Order Service: Order creation, status updates, order history.

Cart Service: Add/remove items, update quantities, persist cart per user.

Payment Service: Integrates with payment gateways (e.g., Stripe), records transactions.

Inventory Service: Tracks stock levels, updates on order placement or restock.

Review Service: Allows users to leave ratings and comments on products.

Admin Service: For admin users to manage products, orders, users, and view analytics.

How Data Flows
User registers/logs in → Auth Service → User collection

User browses products → Product Service → Product & Category collections

User adds items to cart → Cart Service → Cart collection

User places order → Order Service → Order collection, Inventory updated

User pays for order → Payment Service → Payment collection

Order status updated → Order Service

User leaves review → Review Service → Review collection

Example MongoDB Relationships
Order.items references Product.id

Cart.items references Product.id

Review.product_id references Product.id

Order.user_id references User.id

This schema gives you a roadmap for what you'll build.

As you add features, you'll create models for each entity and services for each major function.

You can start with Products and Users, then add Orders, Cart, and Payments as you go.
